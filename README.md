"paramartor" is an invented word based on the idea of parametrized visual art generation.

A website that enables you to creatre artistic images by adjusting parameters used as variables by a prepared piece of code that generates the image.

Inspired by https://natureofcode.com/.

## CS50x

The CS50x course finishes with a final project that leaves much room for creativity. Since I am interested in the intersection of art and programming, I decided to explore this realm.

## tech

-   the p5.js library to draw programmatically
-   nuxt using vue.js
-   element ui
-   vuex as central data store (only for navigation purposes though)

I chose p5.js because it seems to be the leading library for drawing geometric shapes in the browser.

The rest of the stack I chose because I will be working professionally with it soon.

## use

-   git clone
-   npm run dev
